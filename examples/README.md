# Truth.SI Code Examples

Production-quality Python code demonstrating system capabilities.

## Files

- **component_registry_demo.py** - How 23,500+ files are tracked, categorized, and managed
- **component-approval-examples.sh** - Approval workflow with safety checks and batch operations
- **router_metadata_demo.py** - How 719 API routers self-describe their capabilities
- **vmi_integration_example.py** - Value Multiplication Index tracking and Prometheus metrics

## Code Quality Standards

Every file follows:
- Type hints on all public APIs
- Docstrings explaining "why" not just "what"
- Maximum 50 lines per function (NASA Rule #5)
- No bare except clauses
- No hardcoded credentials
- Structured logging

## Running Examples

These examples reference internal APIs and require the full Truth.SI environment to execute. They are provided to demonstrate code quality, architecture patterns, and system design.
