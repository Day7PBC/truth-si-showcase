# Truth.SI — Sovereign Intelligence

## What You're Looking At

This is a curated showcase of **Truth.SI**, a sovereign intelligence platform built by Day7 Engineering. The full system runs on dedicated NVIDIA H200 GPU infrastructure with 5 self-hosted AI models, 5.2 million knowledge graph nodes, and 4.18 million lines of production code — built in 106 days by a single person with AI assistance.

This repository contains architecture documentation, demo scripts, and example code for technical evaluation.

## Quick Stats

- **4.18M** lines of Python (API layer alone)
- **5.2M** knowledge graph nodes with **8.4M** relationships
- **352** autonomous daemons running 24/7
- **8x NVIDIA H200** GPUs (1.15 TB VRAM)
- **5** self-hosted LLMs (no external API dependency)
- **60,800+** git commits in **106 days**
- **9-layer** cognitive architecture (OMEGA)
- **28** Docker services in production

## What's Inside This Repo

**docs/** — Architecture overview, OMEGA production flow, code structure

**demos/** — Demo scripts and Neo4j knowledge graph queries

**examples/** — Sample Python code showing component registration, router metadata, and integration patterns

## What's NOT Inside This Repo

The proprietary systems that make Truth.SI unique — Genesis AI (self-improving code generation), OMEGA layer internals, the development methodology that enables 100-1000x velocity, and 840+ sessions of accumulated intelligence — are available under NDA.

## Next Steps

1. **Review this repo** — See the architecture and scale
2. **Schedule a live demo** — Watch the system in action
3. **NDA for full access** — See the complete codebase and methodology
