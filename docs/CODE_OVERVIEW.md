# Code Overview

## Repository Structure

The full Truth.SI codebase contains 23,500+ Python files across multiple subsystems. This showcase contains selected examples that demonstrate the quality and architecture without exposing proprietary systems.

---

## What's In This Showcase

### docs/
Architecture documentation showing system design, the OMEGA production flow, and capability highlights.

### demos/
Live demo scripts including Neo4j knowledge graph queries that show real data patterns and relationships across millions of nodes.

### examples/
Production-quality Python code demonstrating:
- **Component Registry** — How 23,500+ files are tracked, categorized, and managed
- **Router Metadata** — How 719 API routers self-describe their capabilities
- **VMI Integration** — How the vision-language model processes multimodal input

## What's Protected

| Component | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| Genesis AI | Self-improving code generation engine — core competitive advantage |
| OMEGA internals | 9-layer cognitive processing logic — novel architecture |
| Development methodology | The process that enables 100-1000x velocity — trade secret |
| Session intelligence | 840+ sessions of accumulated decisions and learnings |
| Quality gate system | Automated enforcement that maintains standards at scale |
| Mining systems | Autonomous knowledge extraction — runs 24/7 |

We show the "what" freely. The "how" is available under NDA.

## Code Quality Standards

Every file in the full codebase follows:
- Type hints on all public APIs
- Docstrings explaining "why" not just "what"
- Maximum 50 lines per function (NASA Rule #5)
- No bare except clauses
- No hardcoded credentials
- Parameterized database queries
- Structured logging (no print statements)

## Want the Full Picture?

This showcase proves the quality and scale are real. The full codebase — including Genesis, OMEGA, and the methodology — is available under NDA.
